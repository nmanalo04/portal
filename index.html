       <p>Hello Everyone! My name is Nikaya Manalo, an aspiring Quality Assurance student at Year Up United, where I am focused on developing my skills in application design, Python, and data analysis.</p>
       
       <p>With a strategic mindset, I excel at quickly identifying and resolving issues, consistently seeking innovative solutions to keep projects on track.As a detail-oriented individual, I am dedicated to completing my projects on time while ensuring they meet high standards of quality. </p>
       
       <p>Although I am new to coding, I approach challenges with enthusiasm and a commitment to learning. I prioritize creating measurable outcomes and standards that enhance productivity while maintaining high-quality performance.</p>
           
      <p> In my free time, I enjoy hiking, paddleboarding, and exploring outdoor activities. With winter approaching, Im looking forward to honing my snowboarding skills and 
        i would love to Ice skate sometimes. I also love watching horror movies, playing computer games, and listening to music.</p>

       <p>I once joined an all-girls Valorant team for a tournament without having played with or met the other members beforehand. To our surprise, we emerged as champions, and I was thrilled to be named MVP of the tournament! </p>

    <p>In conclusion, I am excited to embrace new challenges and opportunities as I continue my journey in Quality Assurance. With a passion for learning and a commitment to excellence, I look forward to contributing my skills and creativity to the field. Thank you for allowing me to share a bit about myself, and I can't wait to connect with all of you!</p>
